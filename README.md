GalaxyE Community
=================

The GalaxyE Community is devoted to the creation of resources for **ecology** research conducted through the [Galaxy Project](http://galaxyproject.org/).


This repo contains a subset of Galaxy repositories used in the Tool Shed (https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu).

These repositories are maintained and developed by the GalaxyE team.

Pull Requests with dependencies specified as conda-package will be automatically tested and verified using [planemo](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo). If the tests pass and the pull request is merged, the tool will be automatically uploaded to the [Test](http://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/)- and [Main Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).

Please note, if you don’t want to run the tests or the automatic upload, add `[ci skip]` to the git commit message.
Commits that have [ci skip] anywhere in the commit messages are ignored by Travis CI.
