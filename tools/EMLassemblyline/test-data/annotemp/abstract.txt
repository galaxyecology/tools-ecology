The Dumont D’Urville sea located off George V and Adélie Land, is one of the better known East-Antarctic marine areas displaying a diversity of abiotic and physical parameters that have been shown to drive the distribution of marine organisms. The dataset presented here contributes to our understanding of these interactions, providing essential information for ongoing research and conservation efforts in this Antarctic ecosystem. This dataset presents a table containing abiotic and physical parameters specific to the Dumont D’Urville Sea and a Jupyter notebook to execute a R script in the ecoregionalization Galaxy workflow. The abiotic and physical parameters were first presented in the research article 'Predicting habitat preferences for Anthometrina adriani (Echinodermata) on the East Antarctic continental shelf' by Hemery et al. (2011). The jupyter notebook is dedicated to the pivot_wider function from the tidyr R package. This notebook is the final part of the data preparation for the ecoregionalization Galaxy workflow.
