  Emldown is an old archived ROpensci R package allowing to create beautifull website from Ecological Metadata Language (EML) documents. Thanks to French fund for open science "OpenMetaPaper" project, PNDB biodiversity e-infrastructure impriove the original code allowing taking into account more EML elements (notably semantic annotations, methods and better display of taxonomic coverage) and creating editable docx documents.
